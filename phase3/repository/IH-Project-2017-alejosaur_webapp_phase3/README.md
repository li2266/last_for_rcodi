Brief description:

    First commit: The base design for the page is almost done, the map is on it's 
                  place, and for the next phase the goal is to start working 100% 
                  with the datasets =]
                  
    Seccond commit: I added some datasets, and a form to put the markers in the map, 
                    also, started working with the climate datasets (It's not easy to
                    understand =[) and did the first d3.js chart.
                    
    Third commit: More datasets, graphics for climate, and started with houses things :3

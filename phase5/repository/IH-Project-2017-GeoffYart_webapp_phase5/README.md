Residence Rummager
==================
By: Nathan Fei

This app will use open data to assist in finding, or "rummaging", for housing,
or "residences", for students looking to attend the NYU Stern School of
Business.

Layout
------

For this app, there will be an easy to read map on the right hand side with the
various parameters and criteria with which the prospective resident would like
to constrain results for potential housing on the left. Below the two displays,
there will also be space to show additional data visualizations about the 
selected area of interest.

Data visualizations
-------------------

The most crucial data visualization that is planned for this app is the heat map
which would be overlaid atop the map. Before the user inputs any criteria about
safety, cost, or distance from the School, all of the potential residence areas
will be displayed with helpful color coding. However, as the constraints become
narrower, the least fit residential options would be eliminated from the map,
causing certain areas of the heatmap to disappear. This would give the user an
intuitive and accessible interface to find the most fit residence for them.

Other than the heat map, other statistics can be shown in the area below. For
example, there could be a pie chart showing the distribution of residential
options in areas with various crime rates, utility prices, etc.

Datasets
--------

The [Zillow House Price](https://www.quandl.com/data/ZILLOW-Zillow-Real-Estate-Research?keyword=ny) dataset would allow users to find residences that are
within their budgets, allowing them to choose a living option good for them. It
can also give some suggestions as to the living environment of the area, as the
culture of the area can vary due to housing costs. Various datasets regarding
available options for leisure, such as [museums](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/new-york-city-museums) and [art galleries](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/new-york-city-art-galleries) would also
be helpful for letting users think about what to do in their free time from
school.

Additionally, there is the required [climate dataset](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/api/v2/) that could be used to give
users more information about the living conditions of the place they're
considering.

NYU Stern School of Business

From a viewpoint of user:
A freshman at NYU Stern School of Business wants to find a location to stay at
for the next two years of his life. The mindset of a female student will be very
different from the mindset of the male student.

Male Student Priorities:                Female Student Priorities:
1. Proximity to Campus                  1. Safety of the location
2. Safety of the location               2. Proximity to Campus 
3. Affordabilty                         3. Affordabilty
4. Gym/Park                             4. Restaurants/Bar
5. Restaurant/Bar                       5. Gym/Park

Depending on the gender, the results could be prioritized accordingly. If the
user does not divulge gender information, the priority list of female would be
chosen.

Further datasets such as Community diversity statistics, air pollution data,
closest fuel station data could be added to the above list. Apart from that,
the above priority order can be changed by any user and the user can quickly
view real-time results.

The map would show the top five matches as markers with a following color code.
1st Best Match - Dark Green
2nd Best Match - Light Green
3rd Best Match - Dark Orange
4th Best Match - Light Orange
5th Best Match - Faded Yellow
The colors have been psychologically verified to instill the correct meaning 
into the minds of casual observers.

On choosing a particular marker, a pop-up dialog would show the statistics of
the chosen point in an attractive manner.
The contact information of that apartment would be displayed to the user
if available.

# Purdue IronHacks Fall 2017 - Nicolás Gómez Gutiérrez

1. Name: NYU Renting Places Finder.
2. Keywords: Renting, New York City, Safety, Google Maps API.

3. Description of the datasets and function design
 * The project is using three datasets of data.gov: museums, art galleries and firemen stations.
 * The primary dataset is already linked to the project in the JS file and it will be used in the last iteration.
 * Three datasets are currently working with their full functionality. All of them are from data.gov.

4. Brief Description

 * This project is intended for new students attending at NYU Stern School of Business, helping them to find a safe and affordable renting place near their school without a lot of knowledge about the city. Technically, it is a web interface on HTML, CSS and JS with a Map (implemented with the API of Google Maps) and charts (filled with information of open datasets) that displays valuable information following criteria given by the user.

Fill in the structued description:
 * Map View:
	1. [Y] Basic Map with specific location (your map is located in a meaningful place, city of west lafayette for example)
	2. [N] Not yet.
	3. [N] Not yet.
	4. [N] Not yet.
	5. [N] Not yet.

 * Data Visualization:
	1. [N] Not yet using a graph. Will be implemented in the right bottom div.
	2. [N] A possible interaction with the graph will be studied in future iterations.

 * Interaction Form:
	1. [N] Not yet. Only the position in the layout.
	2. [N] Not yet.
	3. [Y] A selector for the criteria given (budget, security...).
	4. [Y] The interaction with the map is the default given by the Google Maps API.
	5. [N] Not yet. Planning on interaction for the map and the charts (their ubication is in the layout).

5. Build Case
So far, I've only used HTML, CSS and JS. Nothing extra should be installed to open the page on a Linux/Unix machine properly.


6. Test Case
Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera Neon on Windows 10 and Chrome on Linux.


7. Additional information You Want to Share with Us
Design almost over. Planning to work on back-end for next iteration.

3. Description of the datasets and function design
 * [name] [link] [data type] [data columns used] [data amount] Please provide a name+link+basicInfo to each dataset you have used.
 * [Y/N] Do you use the primary dataset ”online climate data” from data.gov?
 * [Y/N] [List] Are all these datasets from data.gov or data.indy.gov? If not, where are they coming from (links)?

4. Brief Description

 * Use a paragraph to introduce your project.

	3. [Y] Labels for markets' names (when clicked).
	4. [Y] InfoWindow to show detail information of a market (when clicked - Google Maps functionality).
	5. [N] Not yet.
  
 * Data Visualization:
	1. [N] Not yet.
	2. [N] Not yet.

 * Interaction Form:
	1. [Y] Selecting criteria is displayed in the map.
	2. [Y] The markers displayed in the map can be chosen by the user.
	3. [Y] Markers for interest places.
	4. [Y] The Google Maps default interaction of the map and its markers.
	5. [N] Not yet.

5. Build Case
So far, I've only used HTML, CSS and JS (with Ajax & JQuery). Nothing extra should be installed to open the page on a Linux/Unix machine properly.

6. Test Case
Which browsers did you test your project on? Chrome, IE, Edge, Safari, or Firefox?

7. Additional information You Want to Share with Us
Hopefully will be able to add the rest of the project for the last iteration.

##### LAYOUT PLAN #####
<!--The overall layout will consist of the map with data on the right side of the-->
<!--screen and the controls/features listed on the left side.-->

Layout is mostly done except for the results section as I have yet to figure out
how to make that work, but I plan to have it be a scrolling list.

##### DATA VISUALIZATION ######
<!--I will heopfully be using heat maps and bubbles to display area data such as -->
<!--crime rate, air quality, etc.-->

<!--A simple 5 star system will be used to quickly show relationship between housing-->
<!--prices for the listings.-->

<!--##### DATA TO BE USED #####-->
<!--I plan to use the follow:-->
<!--zillow_housing_price-->
<!--NY_museums--> THIS IS ON THE MAP
<!--NY_art_galleries-->
<!--NY_farmers_markets-->
<!--NY_vaccination_locations-->
<!--NY_open_data_APIs_(markets_childcare_fishing_liquor_transportation)-->
<!--NY_CityHall_library-->
<!--NY_bicycle_routes_map--> THIS IS ON THE MAP
<!--NY_bankATMs-->
<!--NY_air_quality-->

No work was done with data this phase as I mostly focused on layout and design.

In this stage of the contest, I started messing around with datasets, and drawing
on the map, i.e: now you can see the markers of some museums in the area as an 
example of my desire to emphatize on the cultural benefits of renting a house in
a certain area.
Furthermore, the buttons which previosuly did nothing, now are functional and let
you know they are actualy doing something.
Speaking code-wise, there was a huge amount of jQuery added to the project.

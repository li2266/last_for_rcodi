In the second phase, data was obtained from some of the important data sets for 
the application: Housing New York Units by Building, Air Quality and Weather, in
addition to the Crime Map data set obtained from the Socrata Open Data API at 
"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Crime-Map-/5jvd-shfj/data". Also, 
The first tests of the Zillow API for prices were carried out, where there is
the problem of Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).

At the moment, you can see on the Google map the houses that are for 
rent, and the location of the crimes that have been committed in a radius given 
by the user.

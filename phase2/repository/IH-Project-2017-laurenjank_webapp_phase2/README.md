Program that finds the best fit house or apartment based on user inputs

Intending to create a scaling system for the user to input the 
importance of various items, such as pet-friendly areas, areas near parks,
etc. 

I plan to use graphs to show the facts about each area to help the person
compare the best place to live (air quality, weather, etc.)

I'm currently having trouble understanding how to use object based
programming, so I'm working on the logic in MATLAB and hope to 
transfer this into Javascript.

Submission by: Emily Cottle

Objective: To present the most affordable and safe renting options to NYU students

Data Sets To Be Used:
    (1) Climate Data Online https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2
    (2) Housing New York Units by Building https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/housing-new-york-units-by-building
    (3) Bicycle Routes Across New York State: Map https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/bicycle-routes-across-new-york-state-map
    
Data Set (1):
    Many college environments and urban environments lend themseles better for foot traffic rather than personal cars.
    Especially for the young, poor college student, living in New York City will consist of carless commutes. The student
    would likely travel on foot, by bike, or on public transportation which they would still need to get to by foot or 
    bike or some other similar way. Therefore, the climate data will be used to help indicate which areas are best for
    commuting exposed to the outdoor elements. This data may also be used to display applicable graphics to the location.
    
Data Set (2):
    This data set contains informaion about buildings in New York, their locations, and their availability of rooms in
    various price points. This data set will be used to define affordability for the user. This will also indicate where 
    the available options exist.
    
Data Set (3):
    The availablility and quality of bike paths in an urban setting indicate magnitude of safety in that area because
    having designated bike paths means that travel is safer and a user is less likely to be in a traffic crash. 
    Additionally, the presence of a bike path indicates an area of high enough traffic to be popular and desireable by
    community members - indicating that the area is safer.

Layout:
    The web application will consist of three elements for the layout - a map, recommendations, and available data.
    
Visualization:
    Map: 
        The map will have icons to show the results from the data analysis. The locations on the map will be shown
        with red, yellow, and green colors to indicate how desireable they are based on safety and affordability.
    Recommendations: 
        Beside the map, the safest option and the cheapest option will be featured in their own boxes. These will 
        be larger than other visual images on the app and will have a description of each location.
    Data:
        There will be two charts that show the breakdown of the options in which category of safety and affordability
        repectively.

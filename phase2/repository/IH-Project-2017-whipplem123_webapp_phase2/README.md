Created by github user "whipplem123"

Description of Website:
The web app will always show the safest and the cheapest renting options.
It will also have a slider to allow the user to choose which factor they
want to prioritize, and the renting options with the best combination of
those factors will be displayed along with the safest and cheapest.
The display will include a Google Map with the locations marked; a list
of the top renting options; and bar graphs of important factors like
distance from NYU School of Business, rent cost, commute time, and safety
metrics.

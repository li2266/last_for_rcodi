## webapp_phase2
Did much more Java in this one. Still working on getting a 
sign in and log in together. Not sure if I will still do the roommate
social media aspect of it, but still a possiblity.
The freshness of my project is good, orginal, and coming along. There is 
no price for this site will be free with room for ads on the side, and
the site does not include transportation convenience, but it does have a
location feature coming along that will aid with that.
I'm using 2 data sets right now.
https://www.renthop.com/nyc/nyu-apartments-for-rent
https://www.housingregistry.net/
I used these to redirect site users.
All this was tested on Chrome.
A problem I ran into was that I can not make a new project in ironhacks
where the phases are, so I had to rewrite over others.

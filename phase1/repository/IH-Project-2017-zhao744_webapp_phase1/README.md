[name] [link] [data type] [data columns used] [data amount] Please provide a name+link+basicInfo to each dataset you have used.
Description of the datasets and function design:

Safety: NY_fire_departments [Fire Department Directory for New York State https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/fire-department-directory-for-new-york-state]

 NY_school_safety [School Safety Report https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/school-safety-report-8067a]

Being the main two eligible datasets in the Purdue, these datasets give locations and listings of all fire departments nearby as well as crime data near schools.

Health: NY_air_quality [Dataset contains information on New York City air quality surveillance data
[https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/air-quality-ef520]

, NY_causes_of_Death [New York City Leading Causes of Death 
[https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/new-york-city-leading-causes-of-death-ce97f]

A primary concern for many people living in an urbanized setting, this dataset provides people air quality survaillance in the area they chose to stay
Likewise, people will want to know mortality rates and the reason being around their residential area.

Climate: Climate_Data_Online
[https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2]

For many students, temperature and weather are primary concerns for a daily commuter. This dataset is crucial for everyday planning and routes in case of weather disasters.

Commute: NY_alternative_fuel_stations

[Alternative Fuel Stations in New York https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/alternative-fuel-stations-in-new-york]
,

NY_sidewalks_curbs_ramps_on_statehighways
[Sidewalks and Curb Ramps on the New York State-Owned Highway System https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/sidewalks-and-curb-ramps-on-the-new-york-state-owned-highway-system]

At least one of these will be implemented in my application as commuters also need an informed layout of the city infrastructure in order to optimize commute time to school and home and vice versa.

*Leisure: TBD

A wide variety of leisure datasets are being explored and will be implemented later on.

Gov: DMV_motor_vehicle_department

[Facilities Licensed by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/facilities-licensed-by-the-department-of-motor-vehicles-dmv]

In terms of commuting, it is likely the average commuter will need the proper information of street legal transportation methods. There will be a small button redirect on the webpage that shows a list of this dataset.


 Do you use the primary dataset ”online climate data” from data.gov? Yes

Brief Description
Use a paragraph to introduce your project.
Fill in the structued description:

Essentially, my project is planned to focus on a seamless UI with bootstrap integrations for fluid transition animations between objects.

My goal is to create a website platform and then app that goes in a Gutenberg Z-zig-zag,page half split, striated pattern.

In order to visualize this, here are some proprietary visualizations and sketches:

The initial listings order of rental properties near the NYU campus->Climate->Commute->Health->gov->Safety->Leisure with intermediary revisions along the way

The user of my project will be able to use this website across a variety of platforms as soon as I learn how to implement cross-platform ability.


*Disclaimer: My apologies. There will be a lot of no's or unsure answers tentative at the moment due to my first exposure to these different coding languages.
I will be sure to learn the material as fast and proficiently as I can.

Map View:

[Y/N] Basic Map with specific location (your map is located in a meaningful place, city of west lafayette for example)
Yes, however, I will implement it as soon as I am proficient in it.
[Y/N] Markers for location of markets
Yes, however, I will implement it as soon as I am proficient in its layout.
[Y/N] Labels for markets' names
Yes, however, I will implement it as soon as I am proficient in it.
[Y/N] InfoWindow to show detail information of a market
Yes, however, I will implement it as soon as I am proficient in it.
[Y/N] [describe] Any other cover on the map (for example, cloud cover to show the weather effect)
No, however, I will implement it as soon as I am proficient in it in conjunction to the climate dataset and query.js visualization. 

Data Visualization:

[Y/N] [describe] Use Graph? What is the type? (bar chart, pie chart, radar chart ...)
No, however, I will implement it as soon as I am proficient in it.
[Y/N] [List] Any interaction available on the graph? List them (enable click on numbers, drag on lines, change time/variables ...)
Interaction Form:
No, however, I will implement it as soon as I am proficient in it.

[Y/N] [List] Any information output? list them. (text field, text area, label, plain HTML ...)
No, I am unsure how I will integrate it at the moment. 

[Y/N] [List] Any operation option (filters)? List them. (search markets, search vegetables, filter based on price, sort based on convenience ...)
Yes, this will be in accordance to the lesure section that is in construction.
[Y/N] [List] Any information input? List them. (comments, markers, user preference ...)
Yes, however, I will input it once I am more comfortable with javascript and d3.
[Y/N] [List] Interaction with Map? List them. (filter on price will affect map markers, sort on price will affect map markers, ...)
Yes, however, I am still practicing on how to do this. It will for sure be on the final product.
[Y/N] [List] Interaction with data visualization? List them. (filter, sort, set variables ...)
Yes, however, I am still practicing on how to do this. It will for sure be on the final product.
Build Case How can we build and access your project on a Linux/Unix machine if you use external dependencies besides HTML/CSS/Javascript? List the dependencies you used, such as python, node.js, etc. List the steps we should follow to build the project.

I am exactly unsure on how to do this. But I will, to the best of my ability, enablea compiler of boostrap and perhaps ruby or sql tables depending on the time constraint I have. 
Rest assured, I will figure out how to export the html, js, and css layouts in a zip file on github come near the final iterations of this project.

Test Case Which browsers did you test your project on? Chrome, IE, Edge, Safari, or Firefox?
Currently, I am testing this on chrome. However, I plan for cross platform hopefully with the addition of bootstrap implementation. 

Additional information You Want to Share with Us E.g. any problems you faced/fixed, where you reached out to for help, etc.


My primary concern, as a college of agriculture student, is that the learning curve is very steep and rushed even with online help, tutorials, and in-person sessions.
When looking for inspiration for html, js, or css layouts from example websites, I find myself overwhelmed terminology that I wish to implement but do not know how to.
The online ironhacks forum is primarily my main source of help. Aside from that, I google search W3 Consortiums and codeacademy.

My questions:

Is there a SafeAssign or plagarism checker for codes? I wish to know in order to make sure I am not breaking rules and are within acceptable guidelines of 50% originality.

Once I 'Commit' a project to a phase, can I add a new revision to the commit or are submissions final for each phase?

In other words, can I submit new revisions of the current phase's commit submissions before the deadline?

Thanks!

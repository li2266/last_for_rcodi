# A-Place-to-Stay
Website who's main goal is to help you locate a safe place within your budget.



I plan on having two main pages on the site. 
The first is
    -the main criteria page in which the user selects what they want.
The second page will be 
    -a map with a visual representation of crime rates.
    -filtering options
    -a list of housing options

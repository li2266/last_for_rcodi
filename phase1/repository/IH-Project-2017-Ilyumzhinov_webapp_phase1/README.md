Layout:
So far as I am yet to attend Session 4 which will talk about design elements and layout, 
I have not decided which one I will be using in my project for sure. 
That said, I find the layout – non-distractive window on one side of the (map) view with white background – fitting my goal.

Data Visualisation:
The window that I just described will contain relevant information regarding the selection that a user will have made.
For it to be descriptive and representative, I will surely use different different graphs which I will decide on later on in the dev. process.
A pie chart will be there for sure!

DataBases:
Filling in the pie chart will require different categories which may or may not be considered by the end user.
That is why I am planning on using datasets that do not directly intercourse with each other.
Thus, here are some sample datasets picks that I deem to be relevant.
Population: New York City population by Community.
Price: Housing Price data.
Leisure: New York Museums, Art Galleries.
Convenience: New York Hall Library Catalog, Bank-owened ATM locations.

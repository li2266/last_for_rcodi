## webapp_phase1


The platform will initially show the user the most recommended places, 
based on crime rates, land value and data related to the environment,
can be based on a score given by these aspects.
The recommended places will be found in the first screen under the bar, 
and in the lower part characteristic maps of safety, environment and trade

The website will have a navigation bar to find its place from filters,
or visualize maps with each aspect
One of my goals is to allow the user to calculate routes from each
zone to NYU Stern School of Business

The open data that I will use for now is

- NY population by cencus
- Demographic, Social, Economic, and Housing Profiles by Community District / PUMA
- Total Housing Units By Occupation Status And Tenure By Borough
- Demographic, Social, Economic, and Housing Profiles by Borough
- NY_bicycle_routes_map
- NY_bicycle_routes_data
- NY_neighborhood_names

The resources that I have used for this phase are the tutorials of 
google maps and ironhacks, including one done in one of the classes

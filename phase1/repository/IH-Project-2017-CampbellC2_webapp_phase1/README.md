## webapp_phase1
I am building my code from scratch. I am still working through how
to implement items such as the data set but I am working on it.
I have my general layout, but I want to make this a type of 
social meadia type site, so students can find a safe and affordable
apartment and a roommate. The roommate part is not yet set up.
So my objectives are: 
Create the blueprint roommate finding aspect
Make all the tools on the tool bar work.
My D3 plans are not yet decided yet.
Data set library will be using climate and google maps.

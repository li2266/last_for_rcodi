## bestfitliving_phase1

Program that finds the best fit house or apartment based on user inputs

Intending to create a scaling system for the user to input the 
importance of various items, such as pet-friendly areas, areas near parks,
etc. 

I plan to use graphs to show the facts about each area to help the person
compare the best place to live (air quality, weather, etc.)

Side note:
My code is not at all where I want it to be yet. I'm having some trouble
with my code, but I plan to work very hard to make this website as
nice as I can. I had a family emergency on Sunday at home and fell behind on 
some of my schoolwork, but I fully intend to do much better in the 
upcoming submissions.

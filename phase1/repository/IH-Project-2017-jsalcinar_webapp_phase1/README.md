## webapp_phase1

1. Name of application: webapp_phase1

2. Keywords: efficiency, freshness, simple

3. Datasets and function design: For this phase I didn´t use any datasets

4. Brief Description: For this phase the map in the web page is located in New York City as stated in the problem, the marker in the map
is located at the center of the city. Since the map was brought from Google Maps, you can access all the utilities in Google map,
you can zoom in or zoom out, search place, use the street view, see the satelite map and many other utilities. I dind´t use any datasets
in this phase but I plan to put all the data in tables and use graphs to show the information in a good way. In this phase there is 
only a text in which you can find a brief description of New York and then you can find the sections that the web page is going to have,
at this point there is no interaction with the page expect for the manipulation of the map

5. Build Case: I just run and build my project in the ironhacks interface.

6. Test Case: I alwasy run my project in Google Chrome but it should be ready to run any browser.

7. Additional Information: It would really good if we could have a little more time to commit each phases.

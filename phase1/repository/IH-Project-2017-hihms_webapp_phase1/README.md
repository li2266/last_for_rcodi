    My project so far has 3 .js file, "chart.js", "index.js", and "map.js". 
    Index.js is just a default file I had, so I made a map.js and chart.js as they 
    function seperately. 
    Chart.js is a file for connecting D3, and creating a climate chart to show the
    average temperature monthly for a whole year. 
    Map.js is a file that handles the Google Map API, such as the location and marking
    etc. 

    
Brief description: 
    
    I currently have implemented Google API to my project. It has the origin in NYU,
    which was one of the technical task we have. 
    Also, I succesfully implemented D3.js to draw a chart to display climate data.
    Climate data is from the dataset "Climate Data Online". 
    
    I have not yet implemented the renting place database, which I plan on doing.
    Also, I am going to show the renting option with the cheapest, 
    and another safest rental place.

Details such as the layout that you plan to have:
    
    As you can see in my webpage, I have a right container that holds the map,
    and the left has a collapsing menu so that the user can see the information 
    easily. I think I plan to stick with this design, but if I have extra time,
    I could manybe have another page to display more complex data visualizations.
    
    
Data visualizations that I plan to use:
    
    I made a bar chart for the Climate in NY. I hope to make another one that is
    a line graph or the pie graph. It would be great if I could visualize 
    the safest and closest rent place at the map.

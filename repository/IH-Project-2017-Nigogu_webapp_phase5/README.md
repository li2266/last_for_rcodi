1. Name: NYU Renting Places Finder.
2. Keywords: Renting, New York City, Safety, Google Maps API.

3. Description of the datasets and function design
 * The project is using three datasets of data.gov: museums, art galleries and firemen stations.
 * The primary dataset is already linked to the project in the JS file and it will be used in the last iteration.
 * Three datasets are currently working with their full functionality. All of them are from data.gov.

4. Brief Description

 * This project is intended for new students attending at NYU Stern School of Business, helping them to find a safe and affordable renting place near their school without a lot of knowledge about the city. Technically, it is a web interface on HTML, CSS and JS with a Map (implemented with the API of Google Maps) and charts (filled with information of open datasets) that displays valuable information following criteria given by the user.

5. Build Case
So far, I've only used HTML, CSS and JS (with Ajax & JQuery). Nothing extra should be installed to open the page on a Linux/Unix machine properly.

6. Test Case

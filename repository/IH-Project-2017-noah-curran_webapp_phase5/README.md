Description:
    I plan to create a dynamic website that shows attractive bars of the various 
    stats of the appartments in the area. The appartments
    will be represented as pins, which will be interactable by the user. The pins would be clicked
    on and the data of them would appear on the screen. Sorting algorithms for would not be used as all
    pins on screen would be available for user to interact with. Price ranges would
    allow user to eliminate pins from map. User could check the safety of the pins on map by clicking
    on them, adjusting the index at the bottom of the page. Various entertainments would be taken into
    account, such as museums, resturants and parks. The neighborhoods and public transit would be available
    for user to see so that they may take them into account based on location. The number of apartments 
    tracked based on results would appear at top of webpage, along with various other tracking stats.
    
Incomplete:
    -Unable to figure out how to extract data after obtaining the JSON
    -Unable to put markers to map
    -Dynamic data bars never made dynamic as data was never extracted (a simple index from 0 to 1 would have been sufficient to do this)
    -Tracking stats at top of webpage
    
Datasets used:
    Weather data set
